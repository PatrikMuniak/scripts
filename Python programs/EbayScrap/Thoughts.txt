I have to change the code.
-Open the serp
- pich the ads 
-open individual ad
-take title, price and description

Elements with this part seems to correspond, even not entirely,
 to the ads present in the first page> "<h3 class="lvtitle"><a href=" *total of items with this characteristic are 61 
while sponsored are 11. In the page, from what ebay says, there are 50 ads. 
this means that if I-m able to exclude the sponsored I will get the 50 ads

potential solution 1. soup.h3.a.findall('href')
		

		2. h3=soup.find_all('h3') 
		   for link in h3:
			 links=link.a.find_all('href')



GET THE PRICE

	<span class="notranslate" id="prcIsum" itemprop="price"  style="" content="200.0">£200.00</span>

soup.find_all(span, class="notranslate", id="prcIsum", itemprop="price",  style="")


GET THE TILE

<p class="sbin-title">NOLOGO BLACK Single Speed Freewheel Road Bike Flip Flop hub bicycles Aluminium </p>

soup.find_all(p, class="sbin-title")

GET DESCRIPTION

<meta Property="og:description" Content=
