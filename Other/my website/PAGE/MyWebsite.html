                                                was told to do a search with keywords provided with the Windows
                                                command promt and it was opening each non spinsored ad, and was
                                                taking title, price and description. The data were stored in a new
                                                file excel that would pop up in my Desktop.

                      software. When I was young I’ve been exposed to Html and Python but
                      I couldn’t percive the utility. <br> Just at the beginning of April 2019
                      I become determined to learn to code as I could see that I could save a
                      lot of time and programming could open doors to many challenging
                      opportunities. My goal is to find a job as a Python developers as it’s a
                      challenge that jeeps me motivate like nothing else. </p>

                        where I’ve been building reports for investment funds. So far it’s
                        been a valuable experience. I got a better understanding of how the
                        financial world work and thanks to the time spent here I improved
                        greatly my organisational skills and attention to details. </p>

                      <p>Before graduating in Business Administration at the University of
                        Bologna, I spent my summer working as an intern at Roommate srls.
                        Roommate is an app that helps manage chores, bills and to-buy items
                        and working there it’s been a great experience. I spent 3 months
                        working close to the founders. Seeing so much passion in
                        what they were doing set the ground to my love for tech.
                        I have learned a lot of cool things there, developing foundations in
                        Photoshop, SEO, content creation and Lean method.</p>

                        The “Via Degli Dei” connects Bologna with Florence trough a path of
                        suggestive landscapes. I started this journey Saturday morning and
                        I had to get as far as I could before I could catch up the train at
                        10pm to go back to Bologna. It was a though experience but it taught
                        me that we are stronger than what we think. </p>
